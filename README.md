Screen-Gallery
==============

A full screen, responsive, endless scrolling gallery plugin for wordpress. Not currently under development and not recommended for production use. Feel free to use it in any way you like. Probably GPL or CC0 or something.

Already functional:
	→Endless scrolling
	→Proper resizing
	→Completely independent of theme and sorrounding content, just add [screengallery] 

To be added: 
	→Tag-based filtering. 
	→Backend with easier tag control

Future considerations:
	→Possibility of (roughly) ordering images.
	→Possibility of promoting specific images (appear larger, appear in their own row etc)
