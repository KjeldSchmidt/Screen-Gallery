Screen-Gallery
==============

A full screen, responsive, endless scrolling gallery plugin for wordpress.

Already functional:
	→Endless scrolling
	→Proper resizing
	→Completely independent of theme and sorrounding content, just add [screengallery] 

To be added: 
	→Tag-based filtering. 
	→Backend with easier tag control

Future considerations:
	→Possibility of (roughly) ordering images.
	→Possibility of promoting specific images (appear larger, appear in their own row etc)
